RDL v. 1.1
===========

Please take a look to the file LICENSE before proceeding further.

This software is being developed as a research tool.  We continue to
make significant changes to it.  This is a "alpha" release which
we are doing primarily in order to get feedback.  We want to know what
you think of RDL, so please send comments to us at 
rdl-users@mrg.dist.unige.it.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:
=======================

In order to execute RDL v. 1.1 you need to set the environment
variable SP_PATH.  If the file 'rdl' is rooted in `/home/rdl-1.1/',
then `SP_PATH' should be set to `/home/rdl-1.1/lib/sicstus-3.8.5'
(please use absolute path).  If you work with bash shell then you can
run 'source rdl_setenv' command in the directory `/home/rdl-1.1' to
automatic set of the environment variable SP_PATH.

Now you should be able to execute RDL v. 1.1.  Please see the README
file for informations about the command line options of RDL.

The current distribution has been tested with bash shell only so far.
