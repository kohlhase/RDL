RDL v. 1.1
===========

Please take a look to the file LICENSE before proceeding further.

This software is being developed as a research tool.  We continue to
make significant changes to it.  This is a "alpha" release which
we are doing primarily in order to get feedback.  We want to know what
you think of RDL, so please send comments to us at 
rdl-users@mrg.dist.unige.it.

As mentioned in the file named INSTALL you can execute RDL v. 1.1 to 
issue one among the following two commands at the shell prompt:

  "rdl OPTION"
  "rdl FILE [OPTIONS]" 

where:

* OPTION:
  -h,  --help       display this help and exit
  -v,  --version    output version information and exit
  -ex, --examples   output some examples of usage of the RDL executable

* OPTIONS:
  -ord=ORD, --ordering=ORD   ORD is the ordering used.
                             Currently accepted values:
                               'prolog': lexicographics prolog ordering is used
                               'none'  : no ordering is used
  -pb=PB,    --problem=PB    PB is the problem's name
  -rs=RS                     RS is the reasoning specialist used.
                             Currently accepted values:
