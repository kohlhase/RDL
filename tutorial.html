<H2> RDL Version 1.1: Tutorial </H2>

<B>RDL</B> Version 1.1 is a system for clause simplification in a
quantifier-free first-order logic with equality.  So its input is a
pair of (quantifier-free first-order) clauses in Prolog-like syntax.
The former is the clause to be simplified and the latter is the clause
that the user aims to obtain from the simplification activity of
<B>RDL</B>. (However, specifying the output clause is optional.)
Running <B>RDL</B> on such a pair of clauses results in the final
output

<PRE>Status: ok!</PRE> 

if the result of the simplfication activity of <B>RDL</B> is
syntactically equivalent to the second clause proposed by the user,
and

<PRE>Status: failed!</PRE> 

otherwise.

<P>
Notice that <B>RDL</B> always terminates.  This is because Constraint
Contextual Rewriting (CCR) is terminating (see the paper <a href="../publications.html#ccr-frocos2000">[ccr-frocos2000]</a> for details) and the actual implementation of the system closely resembles the abstract characterization of CCR.
</P>


<P>
Lets start a complete loop through the usage of <B>RDL</B>. Starting
point is always the clause to be simplified.  Assume that you want to
simplify to <EM>true</EM> the following clause:

<P ALIGN="center">
  not(x=<0) \/ rem(x*y,x)=0
</P>

where `not(_)' denotes the negation, `_>_' (`_*_') is the greater-than
relation (multiplication, resp.) over integers, and `rem(_,_)' denotes
the remainder of two integers defined in the usual way.  Furthermore,
assume that you know the following fact about `rem' and `*':

<P ALIGN="center">
  not(U=<0) ==> rem(U*_,U)=0
</P>

where `_==>_' denotes implication.
</P>

<P>
The first step is to write the given clause in the syntax accepted by
<B>RDL</B>.  For the clause above, this is easly done and the result
is the following Prolog list:

<P ALIGN="center">
  [not(x=<0), rem(x*y,x)=0].
</P>

Hence, a clause of the form ``L1 \/ L2 \/ ... \/ Ln'' (where Li is a
literal for i=1, ..., n) is represented in <B>RDL</B> as [l1, l2, ...,
ln], where li is the <B>RDL</B> representation of the literal 
Li (for i=1, ..., n).  
</P>

<P>
The next step is to provide <B>RDL</B> with an input file that
contains exactly the above formulae (i.e. both the clause to be
simplified and the fact about the relationship between `rem' and `*')
in a Prolog-like syntax:

<PRE>
<B>description</B>(zhang_la_bis, 
'Silvio Ranise',                 
'A modified version of zhang_la which copes with  
the ordering of Prolog terms.').                  
<B>fact</B>(zhang_la_bis, rem_rew, [not(U=<0)],rem(U*_,U)=0). 
<B>input</B>(zhang_la_bis, [rem(x*y,x)=0,x=<0]).              
<B>expected_output</B>(zhang_la_bis, la, prolog, [true]).
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
An <B>RDL</B> input file consists of three parts, a description part
(predicate <B>description</B>), a part where all the known facts about
the function and predicate symbols occurring in the clause to be
simplified are given (predicate <B>fact</B>), and a final part where
both the clause to be simplified is presented (predicate <B>input</B>)
and the expected simplified clause as well as two parameters of the
system are given (predicate <B>expected_output</B>).  Let us consider
each part in more details.
</P>

<P>
<OL>
    <LI> <B>description</B>(p, a, d): <EM>p</EM> is a Prolog constant
         uniquely identifying the problem we are going to submit to
         <B>RDL</B>, <EM>a</EM> is a Prolog string identifying the
         author of the problem, and <EM>d</EM> is a Prolog string
         containing a brief description of the problem.

    <LI> <B>fact</B>(p, n, prem, concl): <EM>p</EM> is the Prolog
         constant identifying the problem for which the fact can be
         used, <EM>n</EM> is a Prolog constant uniquely identifying
         the fact within the problem, <EM>prem</EM> is the list of
         premises (i.e. literals) of the fact abd <EM>concl</EM> is
         the conclusion (i.e. atom) of the fact.

    <LI> <B>input</B>(p, clause): <EM>p</EM> is the Prolog constant
         identifying the problem and <EM>clause</EM> is the clause to
         be simplified.

    <LI> <B>expected_output</B>(p, dp, ord, clause): <EM>p</EM> is the
         Prolog constant identifying the problem, <EM>dp</EM> is the
         decision procedure to be used (see <a href="#decproclist">below</a> for details), <EM>ord</EM> is the ordering to be used (again see <a href="#ordlist">below</a> for details), and <EM>clause</EM> is the clause the user aims to obtain from the simplification activity of the system.  Notice that the user is free to leave the expected output clause unspecified by writing a Prolog variable (such as `_') for <EM>clause</EM>.
</OL>
</P>

<P>
<B>RDL</B> must know two settings: 

<OL>
<LI> the <a name="decproclist">decision procedure</a> to use.  The user can select one
     among the following:
     <OL>
     <LI> <EM><B>eq</B></EM>: a decision procedure for ground
              equalities with the augmentation heuristics disabled,
     <LI> <EM><B>aug(eq)</EM></B>: a decision procedure for ground
              equalities with the augmentation heuristics enabled, 
     <LI> <EM><B>la</EM></B>: a decision procedure for linear
              arithmetic with the augmentation heuristics disabled, 
     <LI> <EM><B>aug(la)</EM></B>: a decision procedure for linear
              arithmetic with the augmentation heuristics enabled, 
     <LI> <EM><B>aff(la)</EM></B>: a decision procedure for linear
              arithmetic with the affinization technique enabled so to
              handle non-linear inequalities of the form <EM>s*t =<
              K</EM>, where <EM>s</EM> and <EM>t</EM> are first order
              terms interpreted as integers, and <EM>K</EM> is a
              non-negative integer.
     <LI> <EM><B>aug_aff(la)</EM></B>: a decision procedure for linear
              arithmetic with a combination of the augmentation and
              the affinization techniques enabled so to combine the
              flexibility of the former and the degree of automation
              of the latter.
     <LI> <EM><B>eq_la</EM></B>: a combination of a decision
              procedure for ground equalties and a decision procedure
              for linear arithmetic over integers.
     <LI> <EM><B>aug(eq_la)</EM></B>: a combination of a decision
              procedure for ground equalties and a decision procedure
              for linear arithmetic with the augmentation heuristics
              enabled. 
     <LI> <EM><B>aff(eq_la)</EM></B>: a combination of a decision
              procedure for ground equalties and a decision procedure
              for linear arithmetic with the affinization technique 
	      enabled.
     <LI> <EM><B>aug_aff(eq_la)</EM></B>: a combination of a decision
              procedure for ground equalties and a decision procedure
              for linear arithmetic over integers with a combination 
	      of the augmentation and the affinization techniques 
	      enabled so to combine the flexibility of the former and 
	      the degree of automation of the latter.
     </OL>
<LI> the <a name="ordlist">ordering</a> (if any) to use.  The user can
     select among two options:
     <OL>
     <LI> <EM><B>prolog</EM></B>: the standard Prolog total ordering
          over terms (<a href="http://www.sicstus.org/isl/sicstus/docs/3.8.1/html/sicstus.html#Term%20Compare">see the SICStus manual for details</a>), 
     <LI> <EM><B>none</EM></B>: the ordering is disabled.
     </OL>
</OL>

Choosing an appropriate order is important for the particular form of
rewriting we have adopted in Constraint Contextual Rewriting and hence
in <B>RDL</B>.  We perform a form of ordered (conditional) rewriting
for which we assume that there exists a total ordering over ground
terms.  The ordering is also important for the augmentation
heuristics.  (For details, see the paper <a href="../publications.html#ccr-frocos2000">[ccr-frocos2000]</a>.)
</P>

Then after issuing the command 

<P align="center">
<B>run</B>(zhang_la_bis, la, prolog).
</P>

<B>RDL</B> tries to simplify the input clause until it finds the
simplified clause specified by the user or it is not able to perform
more simplification steps.  In the case of our example, the output of
<B>RDL</B> should be similar to the following:

<PRE>
<B>Problem</B>: zhang_la_bis  
<B>Decision Procedure</B>: linear arithmetic with augmentation disabled.
<B>Ordering</B>: Standard.
<B>Input Formula</B>: 		[x*y rem x=0,x=<0]
<B>Expected Formula</B>: 	[true]
<B>Simplified Formula</B>: 	[true]
<B>Status</B>: ok!
<B>Strategy</B>: osimp:[cl_simp:[cs_extend:[cs_add:[push_poly]],
crew:[crew_rlv:[cxt_entails_true:[cs_extend:[cs_add:
[push_poly>push_poly]]]]]>cxt_entails_true:[cs_extend:
[cs_add:[push_poly]]]]>cl_true]
<B>Time</B> (Elapsed-Theorem Proving): 30-10 msec
</PRE>

Firstly, <B>RDL</B> reminds the problem it is dealing with.  Then, it
recalls the decision procedure used and if augmentation is enabled,
which ordering is used, the input clause, and the user-expected
clause.  Then, after some simplification activity, it prints the ok
status if it was able to find a simplification strategy that reduces
the input clause to the one desired by the user, failed otherwise.
Then it prints the simplified clause and then, the simplification
strategy, i.e. the combination of Constraint Contextual Rewriting
rules that allows to reduce the input to the output clause.  The last
line reports the timings: the former is the time elapsed from the
moment the user entered the run command and the latter is the time
devoted to searching for the expected output clause.
</P>

<P>
There is one command of <B>RDL</B> that we have not covered above: the
predicate <B>pred_sym</B>.  Its use is best illustrated with the
following problem:
<PRE>
<B>description</B>(bm95, 
'Alessandro Armando', 
'This is an example taken from the paper 
"Integrating Decision Procedures in Heuristic Theorem Provers: ..."
by Boyer and Moore, page 95.  Notice that we must disable the ordering.').
<B>pred_sym</B>(bm95, memb(_,_)).
<B>fact</B>(bm95, len_del_less_len, [memb(X,S)],len(del(X,S))< len(S)). 
<B>input</B>(bm95, [not(w>=0), not(k>=0), not(z>=0), not(v>=0),
             not(memb(z,b)),not(w+len(b)=< k), w+len(del(z,b))< k+v]). 
<B>expected_output</B>(bm95, la_aug, none, [true]).
</PRE>

The line <B>pred_sym</B>(bm95, memb(_,_)). tells <B>RDL</B> to
consider `memb' as an interpreted predicate symbol by the decision
procedure (similarly to, e.g., > and >= for the linear arithmetic
decision procedure) because it appears in the precondition of the
fact: <B>fact</B>(bm95, len_del_less_len, [memb(X,S)],len(del(X,S))<
len(S)).
